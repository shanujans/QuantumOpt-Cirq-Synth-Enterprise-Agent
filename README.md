# QuantumOpt-Cirq-Synth-Enterprise-Agent

A Quantum Optimization and Synthesis Agent built using [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq), designed for enterprise-level quantum workflows and experimentation. This project is presented as a Jupyter Notebook and is ready to run on Kaggle.

## Features

- **Quantum Circuit Synthesis**: Automated generation and optimization of quantum circuits using Cirq.
- **Enterprise Focus**: Scalable design targeting enterprise research and practical applications.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive Python notebook for step-by-step quantum development.
- **Kaggle Integration**: Easily run and experiment on [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shanujan/quantumopt-cirq-synth-enterprise-agent).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shanujans/QuantumOpt-Cirq-Synth-Enterprise-Agent.git
   ```

2. **Install requirements:**

   The main dependency is [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) and Jupyter. Install with pip:

   ```bash
   pip install cirq jupyter
   ```

   Additional dependencies may include `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc., depending on your workflow.

3. **Run the notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook QuantumOpt-Cirq-Synth-Enterprise-Agent.ipynb
   ```

   Or [run on Kaggle directly](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shanujan/quantumopt-cirq-synth-enterprise-agent).

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter/IPython notebook.
- Follow the code cells and documentation to design, optimize, and analyze quantum circuits.
- Modify parameters and code for custom experiments and workflows.
